TFLite Model Integration

Our app leverages a TFLite (TensorFlow Lite) model to enable [mention the purpose of using the model, e.g., image recognition, natural language processing, etc.]. Here's how you can integrate it:

Prerequisites
Before you proceed with the integration, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Clone the TFLite model integration repository:
shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ritz-17/tflitemodel
Navigate to the project directory:
shell
Copy code
cd tflitemodel
[Add more specific instructions on how to set up the TFLite model, including any model files, dependencies, or configuration changes required]
[Provide instructions on how to use the TFLite model within the app]
